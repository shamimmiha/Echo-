# 1. INTRODUCTION TO AI AND ML

## 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (Al) is the ability of machines or computer programs to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.

**Simple explanation:**
Al is when machines are made smart enough to think and act like humans.

**Examples:**
* Voice assistants like Alexa
* Image recognition systems
* Chatbots
* Self-driving cars

## 1.2 Types of Al: Narrow Al vs. General Al

**Narrow Al (Weak Al):**
* Designed to perform one specific task
* Cannot do anything beyond its programming
* Examples: Email spam filters, facial recognition, recommendation systems

**General Al (Strong Al):**
* Still under research and development
* Can learn and perform any intellectual task a human can do
* Would have reasoning, memory, and decision-making abilities similar to a human

## 1.3 What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning is a subfield of Al that allows machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

**Simple explanation:**
* Instead of writing rules for everything, we give the machine data, and it figures out the rules on its own.

**Example:**
* A machine learns to identify spam emails by studying thousands of examples.

# 1. INTRODUCTION TO AI AND ML

## 1.4 Supervised vs. Unsupervised vs. Reinforcement Learning

**Supervised Learning:**
* The training data includes both input and the correct output (labels)
* The model learns by comparing its output with the correct output
* Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.

# 2. MATHEMATICS FOR $ML/Al$

Mathematics is the foundation of Al and Machine Learning. It helps us understand how algorithms work under the hood and how to fine-tune models for better performance.

## 2.1 Linear Algebra

* Linear Algebra deals with numbers organized in arrays and how these arrays interact. It is used in almost every ML algorithm.

### 2.1.1 Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors

**Vector:** A 1D array of numbers. Example: `[3, 5, 7]`
* Used to represent features like height, weight, age.

**Matrix:** A 2D array (rows and columns).
* Example: `[[2,4], [6, 8]]`
* Used to store datasets or model weights.

**Tensor:** A generalization of vectors and matrices to more dimensions (3D or higher).
* Example: Used in deep learning models like images (3D tensor: width, height, color channels).

### 2.1.2 Matrix Operations

* **Addition/Subtraction:** Add or subtract corresponding elements of two matrices.
* **Multiplication:** Used to combine weights and inputs in ML models.
* **Transpose:** Flip a matrix over its diagonal.

### 2.1.3 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

**Eigenvector:** A direction that doesn't change during a transformation.
**Eigenvalue:** Tells how much the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk.
* These are used in algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

---

# 2. MATHEMATICS FOR $ML/Al$

## 2.2 Probability and Statistics

* Probability helps machines make decisions under uncertainty, and statistics helps us understand data and model performance.

### 2.2.1 Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation

* **Mean:** The average value.
* **Variance:** How spread out the values are from the mean.
* **Standard Deviation:** The square root of variance. It measures how much the values vary.
* Used to understand the distribution and behavior of features in datasets.

### 2.2.2 Bayes Theorem

* A mathematical formula to calculate conditional probability:
* $P(A|B)=[P(B|A)*P(A)]/P(B)$
* Used in Naive Bayes classifiers for spam detection, document classification, etc.

### 2.2.3 Conditional Probability

* The probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
* **Example:**
    * Probability that a user clicks an ad given that they are between 20-30 years old.

### 2.2.4 Probability Distributions

* **Normal Distribution:** Bell-shaped curve. Common in real-world data like height, exam scores.
* **Binomial Distribution:** Used for yes/no type outcomes. Example: Flipping a coin 10 times.
* **Poisson Distribution:** For events happening over a time period. Example: Number of customer calls per hour.
* These distributions help in modeling randomness in data.

---

# 2. MATHEMATICS FOR $ML/Al$

## 2.3 Calculus for Optimization

* Calculus helps in training models by optimizing them to reduce errors.

### 2.3.1 Derivatives and Gradients

* **Derivative:** Measures how a function changes as its input changes.
* **Gradient:** A vector of derivatives that tells the slope of a function in multi-dimensions.
* Used to find the direction in which the model should adjust its weights.

### 2.3.2 Gradient Descent

* An optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss (error) function.

**How it works:**
1.  Start with random values
2.  Calculate the gradient (slope)
3.  Move slightly in the opposite direction of the gradient
4.  Repeat until the loss is minimized

* Gradient Descent is the core of many training algorithms in ML and DL.

---

# 3. DATA PREPROCESSING

Before feeding data into any machine learning model, it must be cleaned, transformed, and prepared. This step is called data preprocessing, and it is one of the most important stages in building accurate ML models.

## 3.1 Data Cleaning

* Real-world data is often messy. Data cleaning means identifying and fixing errors in the dataset.

### 3.1.1 Missing Values

* Missing values can be due to incomplete forms, sensor errors, etc.
* Techniques to handle missing data:
    * Remove rows/columns with too many missing values
    * Fill (impute) missing values using:
        * Mean/Median/Mode
        * Forward/Backward fill
        * Predictive models (like KNN)

### 3.1.2 Outliers

* Outliers are data points that are very different from others.
* They can distort results and reduce model performance.
* **Detection methods:**
    * Box plot, Z-score, IQR method
* **Handling outliers:**
    * Remove them
    * Transform data (e.g., log scaling)
    * Cap them (set a maximum/minimum)

## 3.2 Data Normalization and Standardization

* Helps scale numeric data so that features contribute equally to the model.

**Normalization (Min-Max Scaling):**
* Scales all values between 0 and 1
* Formula: `(x - min)/(max - min)`
* Used when the data is not normally distributed

**Standardization (Z-score Scaling):**
* Centers the data around mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1
* Formula: `(x - mean) / std`
* Used when data is normally distributed

---

# 3. DATA PREPROCESSING

## 3.3 Encoding Categorical Variables

* ML models work with numbers, not text. Categorical data needs to be converted into numerical form.

**Label Encoding:**
* Assigns each unique category a number.
* Example: `Red -> 0, Blue -> 1, Green -> 2`

**One-Hot Encoding:**
* Creates new binary columns for each category.
* Example: `Red [1,0,0], Blue [0,1,0], Green [0,0,1]`
* Label encoding is good for ordinal data (ranked), while one-hot encoding is best for nominal data (non-ranked).

## 3.4 Feature Scaling

* Ensures features are on the same scale so the model can learn effectively.

**Min-Max Scaling:**
* Scales features between 0 and 1.
* Good for algorithms like KNN, neural networks.

**Z-score Scaling (Standardization):**
* Useful for models that assume normality, like linear regression or logistic regression.
* Scaling is crucial for models that use distance or gradient-based optimization.

## 3.5 Feature Engineering

* Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

**Polynomial Features:**
* Create new features by raising existing features to a power.
* Example: From x, create $x^{2}$, $x^{3}$

**Binning (Discretization):**
* Convert continuous data into categories.
* Example: Age [0-18], [19-35], [36-60], 60+
* Feature engineering can significantly boost the predictive power of a model.

---

# 3. DATA PREPROCESSING

## 3.6 Handling Imbalanced Data

* In classification, if one class dominates (e.g., 95% non-fraud, 5% fraud), models may ignore the minority class.
* This is called class imbalance.

**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):**
* Creates synthetic examples of the minority class using nearest neighbors.

**Undersampling:**
* Remove some samples from the majority class.

**Oversampling:**
* Duplicate or generate more samples of the minority class.
* Balancing data improves the ability of the model to correctly predict both classes.

---

# 4. SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS

Supervised learning uses labeled data, meaning the model learns from input-output pairs $(x \rightarrow y)$. The algorithm tries to map inputs (features) to correct outputs (targets/labels).

## 4.1 Linear Regression

* Used for predicting continuous values (e.g., predicting house price, temperature).

### 4.1.1 Simple vs. Multiple Linear Regression

* **Simple Linear Regression:** One input (X) to predict one output (Y).
* Example: Predicting salary from years of experience.
* **Multiple Linear Regression:** Multiple inputs $(X1, X2, ..., Xn)$.
* Example: Predicting price based on area, location, and age.

### 4.1.2 Gradient Descent and Normal Equation

* **Gradient Descent:** Iterative method to minimize error (cost function).
* **Normal Equation:** Direct way to find weights using linear algebra:
* $\theta=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}Y$
* Works for small datasets.

---

# 4. SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS

### 4.1.3 Regularization (L1, L2)

* Prevents overfitting by adding a penalty:
* **L1 (Lasso):** Can reduce coefficients to 0 (feature selection).
* **L2 (Ridge):** Shrinks coefficients but doesn't make them 0.

## 4.2 Logistic Regression

* Used for classification problems (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

### 4.2.1 Binary vs. Multiclass Classification

* **Binary:** 2 outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1)
* **Multiclass:** More than 2 classes (handled using One-vs-Rest or Softmax)

### 4.2.2 Sigmoid and Cost Function

* **Sigmoid Function:** Converts outputs to values between 0 and 1.
* `sigmoid(z) = 1/(1+e^-z)`
* **Cost Function:** Log loss used to measure prediction error.

### 4.2.3 Regularization

* L1 and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting in logistic regression as well.

---

# 5. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, it doesn't rely on labeled outputs (no predefined target).

## 5.1 K-Means Clustering

### 5.1.1 Algorithm Overview

* K-Means is a clustering algorithm that divides data into K clusters based on similarity.
* It works by:
    * a. Selecting K random centroids.
    * b. Assigning each point to the nearest centroid.
    * c. Updating the centroid to the mean of its assigned points.
    * d. Repeating steps 2-3 until the centroids stop changing.

### 5.1.2 Elbow Method

* Used to choose the optimal number of clusters (K).

## 5.2 Hierarchical Clustering

---

# 5. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS

### 5.2.1 Agglomerative vs. Divisive Clustering

* **Agglomerative (bottom-up):** Start with each point as its own cluster and merge the closest clusters.

* Agglomerative is more commonly used.

### 5.2.2 Dendrogram and Optimal Cut

* A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that shows how clusters are formed at each step.

---

# 5. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS

# 6. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL)

## 6.1 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

* Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
* It is inspired by how humans learn from experience - by trial and error.
* The agent performs an action
* The environment responds with a reward
* The agent uses this feedback to learn better actions over time
* Unlike supervised learning, RL doesn't rely on labeled data. Instead, it uses rewards or penalties to guide learning.

## 6.2 Key Concepts

* **Agent:** The learner or decision maker (e.g., a robot, self-driving car).
* **Environment:** Everything the agent interacts with (e.g., a maze, a game).
* **State:** A snapshot of the current situation (e.g., position in a maze).
* **Action:** A move or decision made by the agent (e.g., turn left).
* **Reward:** Feedback from the environment (e.g., +1 for reaching goal, -1 for hitting a wall).
* The goal of the agent is to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

## 6.3 Markov Decision Process (MDP)

* RL problems are often modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
* An MDP includes:
    * **S:** Set of states
    * **A:** Set of actions
    * **P:** Transition probabilities ($P(s'|s,a)$)
    * **R:** Reward function
    * **$\gamma$ (gamma):** Discount factor (how much future rewards are valued)
* The "Markov" property means the next state only depends on the current state and action, not on previous ones.

---

# 6. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL)

## 6.4 Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

**Q-Learning:**
* A model-free algorithm that learns the value (Q-value) of taking an action in a state.
* Uses the formula:
    $Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha[r + \gamma \max Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]$
* Where:
    * **s:** current state
    * **a:** action
    * **r:** reward
    * **s':** next state
    * **$\alpha$:** learning rate
    * **$\gamma$:** discount factor

**Deep Q-Networks (DQN):**
* When the state/action space is too large, a neural network is used to approximate Q-values.
* Combines Q-Learning with Deep Learning.
* Used in Atari games and robotics.

## 6.5 Policy Gradients and Actor-Critic Methods

**Policy Gradients:**
* Instead of learning value functions, learn the policy directly (probability distribution over actions).
* Use gradient ascent to improve the policy based on the reward received.

**Actor-Critic Methods:**
* Combine the best of both worlds:
* **Actor:** chooses the action
* **Critic:** evaluates how good the action was (value function)
* More stable and efficient than pure policy gradients.

---

# 6. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL)

## 6.6 Exploration vs. Exploitation

* **Exploration:** Trying new actions to discover their effects (important early in training).
* **Exploitation:** Choosing the best-known action for maximum reward.
* RL must balance both:
    * Too much exploration = slow learning
    * Too much exploitation = stuck in local optimum
* **Common strategy: $\epsilon$-greedy**
    * Choose a random action with probability $\epsilon$
    * Otherwise, choose the best-known action

---

# 7. NEURAL NETWORKS & DEEP LEARNING

## 7.1 Introduction to Neural Networks

* A neural network is a computer model inspired by the human brain. It consists of neurons (nodes) organized in layers, capable of learning patterns from data.

### 7.1.1 Perceptrons

* The perceptron is the simplest type of neural network, with:
* Inputs $\rightarrow$ Weights $\rightarrow$ Summation $\rightarrow$ Activation Function $\rightarrow$ Output
* It's like a yes/no decision maker (binary classification).

### 7.1.2 Activation Functions

* These introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex functions:
* **Sigmoid:** Outputs between 0 and 1. Good for probability-based outputs.
* **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Most popular. Fast, reduces vanishing gradient.
* `ReLU(x) = max(0, x)`
